  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Polly, I am from Eastern Siberia Russia. I was born on December 10<sup>th.</sup> Last year I graduated my high school and took a gap year before college. During this year I have been working and preparing for my studies abroad. I finished art school and I always wanted to be in art sphere and at the same time combine technical skills, such as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> with creative, that is why I have chosen the program Interactive media design.</p>

  <p>As for my hobbies, <em>I like painting, design, photography and videography.</em> During this year I have been working as a web designer on frilance, and I can say that I truly enjoy creating design solutions for web sites. I want to get as many profeccional skills from this program as possible and find a job in art sphere after graduation.</p>
